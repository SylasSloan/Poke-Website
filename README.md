Pokémon Site — Documentation

Overview

This repository contains a single-file, client-side web app: `Test Site.html`. The app renders a browsable Pokémon list, supports filtering by region and type, lazy-loaded sprites, persistence of user progress (seen/caught), favorites, and import/export of progress. It is intentionally dependency-free and runs in any modern browser (file:// or served over http/https).

Goals of this documentation

- Explain the code structure so developers can understand and extend the app.
- Describe the data model and storage formats used by the app.
- Provide development and debugging guidance.
- Document user-visible features and keyboard shortcuts.

Quick start (developer)

1. Open `Test Site.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox). If running from the filesystem you may need to use the in-browser file picker to load `json/pokemon-full-data.json` if CORS/file:// restrictions apply.
2. Edit `Test Site.html` in your editor and refresh the browser to see changes.

Project layout

- `Test Site.html` — single-file application containing HTML, CSS, and JS. This is the core of the project and where you will do most edits.
- `js/` — optional helper scripts (data generators, e.g., `pokemon-data.js` may be generated by Python scripts).
- `json/` — optional JSON data files. `pokemon-full-data.json` contains the full dataset used by the app.
- `png/` — small icons and images used by the UI.
- `python/` — helper scripts used to generate/enrich data; not required to run the front-end.

Top-level documents

- `README.md` (this file) — general overview and quick start.
- `docs/` — detailed developer documentation (architecture, data model, development workflow, storage keys, and usage). See that folder for in-depth guides.

Key contacts / maintainers

- The repository is intended to be self-explanatory via the docs and inline comments. If you have questions, open an issue or add README notes with your findings.


License & attribution

- This repository does not include a license file. Add one (e.g., MIT) if you intend to share the project publicly.


Files changed by automated improvements

During a maintenance pass the following optimizations were applied to `Test Site.html`:
- Delegated event handling for repeated UI elements to reduce memory pressure.
- Shared IntersectionObserver for image lazy-loading (reused instead of creating many observers).
- Cached parsed `pokemonProgress` in `StorageManager` to avoid repeated JSON.parse calls.
- Debounced resize and search handlers to reduce re-renders.
- Responsive grid layout using CSS grid's `auto-fit` + `minmax()` to avoid cramped cards.
- Collapsible left types panel with animated transition and persistence.

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` for details.
